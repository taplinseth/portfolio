        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm Seth Taplin, a software engineer with a passion for
          building things for the web. I graduated from a rigorous coding
          bootcamp program, where I honed my skills in Javascript, HTML/CSS,
          React.js, MySql, Node.js, and Next.js. My experience with these
          technologies has allowed me to create dynamic and responsive web
          applications that meet the needs of clients and users alike. In
          addition, I also have experience with Python, C++, and Java, which has
          given me a broader perspective on software development and enabled me
          to tackle a wide range of projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors,
          tackling a challenging rock climbing route, or enjoying a board game
          with friends. I value clear communication, attention to detail, and
          collaboration in my work, and am always seeking new opportunities to
          expand my skills and knowledge in the field of software engineering.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to get to know me!</p>
